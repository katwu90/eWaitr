# eWaitr
My vision for this web app is for restaurants to be able to create their menus and have their customers be able to view their menu on an iPad or some other tablet device. Customers would be able to make orders and be sent to the kitchen without the need for a waiter to come to their table and take their order. It would provide much quicker service at restaurants without having to wait for the the waiter to be available to come by the table and take your order. Instead, the host will be able to seat their customers at the table with the app open and they can choose from the menu what they want to order immediately.

## Work To Be Continued
The other resources (customers & orders) for this application has not been implemented yet. I am still working on creating a customers and customers making orders. I will also eventually want to create a separate table for Food Categories so that all the appetizers and entrees are grouped together, instead of separately as they are right now.
